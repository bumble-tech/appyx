# Model-driven navigation


## Your own navigation model

Generally speaking, most navigation solutions have fixed navigation mechanisms (e.g. a back stack).

Appyx gives you the freedom to define your own navigation model. For example, you can implement any of the examples you see here with the same approach:

## No screen, only a viewport

Generally speaking, most navigation solutions model a "Screen" and focus on how to get from one screen to another.

Appyx does not have the concept of the screen in its model â€“ there's only a viewport, and whatever fills the available space will feel like the screen to the user.

This freedom allows you to implement:

- navigation that feels like going from "screen to screen"
- navigation "inside the screen"
- navigation that bridges between the two

For example, you can transform the screen itself as part of navigation:

## NavModels

A `NavModel` implements any of the above mechanisms. 

See [NavModels](../navmodel/index.md) for more details. 


## Composable navigation

`NavModels` in Appyx are composable.

See [Composable navigation](composable-navigation.md) for more details.
