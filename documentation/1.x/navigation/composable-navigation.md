# Composable navigation

[NavModels](../navmodel/index.md) in Appyx are composable. 

As a single `NavModel` won't be enough for the whole of your whole app, you can use many in a composable way. That is, any navigation target of a `NavModel` can also host its own `NavModel`.


## Structural element for composing navigation

```Nodes``` are the main structural element in Appyx. They can host `NavModels`, and they form a tree.

This allows you to make your app's business logic also composable by leveraging `Nodes` as lifecycled components.

## Navigation in the tree

Once you've structured your navigation in a composable way, you can add `NavModels` to `Node` of this tree and make it dynamic:

- Some parts in this tree are active while others ore not
- The active parts define what state the application is in, and what the user sees on the screen
- We can change what's active by using `NavModels` on each level of the tree
- Changes will feel like navigation to the user

See [Implicit navigation](implicit-navigation.md) and [Explicit navigation](explicit-navigation.md) for building complex navigation behaviours with this approach.



## How NavModels affect Nodes

NavModel operations will typically result in:

- Adding or removing child `Nodes` of a `ParentNode`
- Move them on and off the screen
- Change their states

As an illustration:

Here:

- `Back stack` illustrates adding and removing child `Nodes`
- `Tiles` illustrates changing the state of children and removing them from the `ParentNode`

These are just two examples, you're of course not limited to using them.
