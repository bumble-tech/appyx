# Appyx


Model-driven navigation for Jetpack Compose

[https://github.com/bumble-tech/appyx](https://github.com/bumble-tech/appyx)


## Navigation for your Compose app on steroids

- **Navigate directly from code** – In a type-safe way, without boilerplate
- **Gain control of navigation state** – Making your navigation unit-testable
- **Complete control over operations and behaviour** – Use and extend the back stack or the view pager from the library, or build your own 
- **Your own navigation** – With Appyx, you can define your own navigation models
- **Use any animation for transitions** – Anything you can represent with Compose `Modifiers`


## Model-driven navigation – a different paradigm with superpowers

Using Appyx you gain navigation superpowers in addition to screen-to-screen navigation:  

- **Break down screen boundaries** – Using `NavModels` you can navigate inside the screen as well as between them
- **Make your navigation composable** – Navigate whole scopes of your application 

Using a model-driven approach, navigation states are yours to define – Appyx makes it happen with any animation you can represent using Compose `Modifiers`. Back stacks, card stacks, view pagers are just the beginning:

You can create custom navigable components in no time:

With Appyx you can break down screen boundaries and transform the screen itself:
