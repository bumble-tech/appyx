# Appyx + ViewModel

We've experimented with adding ViewModel support for Appyx Nodes, however the solution is not finalised.

You can track and vote on the issue here:

## Alternative: `RetainedInstanceStore`

Even without a direct ViewModel support, you can pretty much achieve the same by using the [RetainedInstanceStore](../features/surviving-configuration-changes.md) Appyx provides.
